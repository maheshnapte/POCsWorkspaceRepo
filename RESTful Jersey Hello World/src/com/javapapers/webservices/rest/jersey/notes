// Note:

Before running a dynamic webapp in server in eclipse, if it wants any libraries which are not present on tomcat server,
you need to copy that libraries to WebContent->WEB-INF-lib folder.
Note: When you add these libraries to build path and build the project, these libraries not be copied to lib folder automatically.
You need to copy these libraries manually to lib. If these libraries are not present in server, and if you do not copy these libraries manually to lib folder then the project will not run.
