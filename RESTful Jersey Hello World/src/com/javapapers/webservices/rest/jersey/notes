// Note:

Before running a dynamic webapp in server in eclipse, if it wants any libraries which are not present on tomcat server,
you need to copy that libraries to WebContent->WEB-INF-lib folder.
Note: When you add these libraries to build path and build projec, these ibraries not not be copied to lib folder automatically.
This might(not sure) be automated by making changes in .classpath folder.
